Hello my name is Matan Motyka and this is my first ever web project I tried to put a lot of 
my creativity into this project unfortunately I had very limited time to invset in this project but
I still managed to do a lot of stuff I had in mind, the whole design and everything was all my idea
and with the help of ChatGP and some digging in websites I was able to learn fast cool and new things.
JavaScript is the easiest part for me because I learned codding for LUA language when I was 15 completely
by my self, I managed to understand the logic behind everything all by myself I kept trying, testing
and seening things repeating and slowly with time I learned how to program on a high level in that language
and this gives me a big advantage in JavaScript because not only that I understand it pretty easily and quite fast
I understand the logic behind the things I learned alone so far and also what we learn in class.
thank you for reading if you did =D and I hope you like my project.

Note: All the music I used in this project is COPY RIGHT FREE and I also added credits in the website when
music is being played.
